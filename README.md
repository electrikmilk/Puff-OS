# Puff-OS

Puff is a [web desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_desktop) based in a LAMP envrionment.

Mostly a hobby project right now. I've worked on stuff like this in the past but never in a serious capacity and I didn't know that a web desktop was something people have actually used in the past.

This project is a WIP (alpha 0.1). Most of the apis and applications are still being developed and worked on.
