# Puff-OS

Puff is a [web desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_desktop), made in a LAMP envrionment.

Mostly a hobby project right now. I've worked on stuff like this in the past but never in a serious capacity and I didn't know that a web desktop was something people have actually used in the past. This is something I might want to make public for fun at some point.

This project is a WIP, so most of the apis and applications are still being worked on.

It has a UI inspired by modern UIs like iOS 14 & Big Sur, but also by old versions of OS X and the Ambience theme from GNOME 2 in Ubuntu. I wanted to create a modern version of the UIs I grew up admiring.
