<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>This is a hobby webtop project. I have made a few of these in the past, this one being the most refined and the first public one.</p>
<p>Check out the template app, it's very easy to create an app.</p>
<p>Please report any issues using GitHub. The report bug app techically works, but is for production use only.</p>
